# DC-Adopt

[Heroku Deployment](https://dc-adopt.herokuapp.com/)

Sometimes we find ourselves in a situation where we have to make a difficult decision. Perhaps we get sick, have to move far away, or maybe you come across a stray that you canâ€™t keep. Finding a no-kill shelter can be tough, and even with finding one, shelters can be filled with diseases, and pets too often do not get the best care. We decided to cut out the middle-man, allowing pet owners to connect with each other online and find a forever-home for their pet.

Our web application allows users to create a profile, add pet information, save pets that they might be interested in adopting, view a pet owners information, and edit pet listings to provide the most current information.
We understand how difficult it can be to have to let go of a pet, therefore we decided connecting pet owners to pet adopters will make the process much easier for everyone, including your furry friend!
